- Hi, I’m @xhumberg, a prefessional Backend Software Developer based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. 
- My expreience is primarily in Java, though I love branching out into lighter-weight backend implementations such as Node.js and Go.
- Outside of work, I help organize and run Pathfinder Society throughout the Wasatch Front!
- I’m currently learning React, K8s, Kafka, and general microservice practices.
